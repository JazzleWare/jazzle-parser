if we are in versions less than 5, then they are mere id's.
if they come at the start of a for, they are sent to parseLetConst with the context CONTEXT_FOR
if they come at the start of a statement, they are sent to parseLetConst
if they are anywhere else, they would be mere id's, unless we are in strict mode, in which case they are reserved words (and cause an error.)


The parseLetConst function always parses a declaration; however if the returned declaration has no declarators, it returns an id ,     unless we are in strict mode, in which case they are reserved words (and cause an error.)
